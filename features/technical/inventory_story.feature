       And inventory pool short name 'ABC'
       Given a category 'Cameras' exists
       And a category 'Video Equipment' exists
       And a category 'Film' exists

       And the label of the direct children are 'Video Cameras'
       When the category 'Film' is selected    
       Then there are 0 direct children and 0 total children
       When the category 'Video' is selected   
       Then there are 1 direct children and 1 total children
       And the label of the direct children are 'Filters'
       When the category 'Filters' is selected 
       Then there are 0 direct children and 0 total children           


  Scenario: Models organized in categories
       Given inventory pool 'ABC'
       And inventory pool short name 'ABC'
       Given a category 'Cameras' exists
       And a category 'Video' exists
       And a model 'Sony 333' exists
       And the model 'Sony 333' belongs to the category 'Cameras'

  Scenario Outline: What we want new generated inventory codes to look like
      Given inventory pool 'ABC'
      And inventory pool short name 'ABC'
      Given item '<inventory_code>' of model 'Trumpet' exists
      When leihs generates a new inventory code
      Then the generated_code should look like this '<result>'

      Examples:
       | inventory_code | result     |
       | 123            | ABC124     |
       | ABC127         | ABC128     |
       | 123ABC999      | ABC1000    |
       |                | ABC1       |
       | ABC2008012     | ABC2008013 |
       | ABC            | ABC1       |

  Scenario: Fill in holes in existing inventory code ranges when proposing new codes
      Given inventory pool 'ABC'
      And inventory pool short name 'ABC'
      Given a model 'Trumpet' exists
       And we have items with the following inventory_codes:
           | inventory_code |
           |          ABC02 |
           |          ABC03 |
           |          ABC06 |
           |          ABC07 |
           |          ABC10 |
           |          ABC11 |
       # we sleep one second, since mysql's datetime is only precise to a second
       # and thus subsequently created items wouldn't get sorted right
      When wait 1 seconds
       And we add an item 'ABC08'
       And leihs generates a new inventory code
      # first free inventory code after 'ABC08' is 'ABC9'
      Then the generated_code should look like this 'ABC9'
      When wait 1 seconds
       And we add an item 'ABC01'
       And leihs generates a new inventory code
      # first free inventory code after 'ABC01' is 'ABC4'
      Then the generated_code should look like this 'ABC4'
